%% DESCRIPTION
%FINDCLOSER is used the closest valor to calorIn in the vector (Xx1 array)
%vectorIn
%   PARAMETERS:
%       valorIn
%           is a number
%
%       vectorIn
%           is a Xx1 array of numbers
%   
%   OUTPUT
%       indOut in the indice in vectorIn where the closest valor to valorIn
%       can be found
